                                                      Virtual Background Replacement
Abstract:This project demonstrates a real-time virtual background replacement technique using OpenCV. By leveraging color-based segmentation in the HSV color space, the system isolates a person from a uniform background (typically green or similar hue) and replaces it with a custom virtual background. This method mimics the green screen effect commonly used in video production and conferencing tools. The project offers an efficient, real-time solution for background removal without the need for deep learning or specialized hardware.

Purpose:The purpose of this project is to enable real-time background substitution for video streams, offering privacy and aesthetic customization for applications such as:

1.Video conferencing

2.Online streaming

3.Virtual events

4.Educational content creation

It provides an affordable and lightweight alternative to commercial virtual background tools.

                                                           Technologies Used
1.Python – Programming language for implementation.

2.OpenCV – Used for image capture, color space conversion, masking, and blending images.

3.NumPy – Used for efficient numerical and array operations.

4.Webcam – Captures real-time video input.

                                                            Working Principle
1.Input Setup:
           -The webcam captures a live video stream.
           -A custom background image is loaded and resized to match the frame size.

2.Color Segmentation:
           -Each video frame is converted from BGR to HSV color space for better color detection.
           -A mask is created to detect a specific color range (e.g., green screen background).
           -The inverse mask isolates the person from the frame.

3.Image Blending:
           -The selected background replaces the masked regions (original background) of the live frame.
           -The person and background are combined to create the final output.

4.Display:
           -The final composite image is displayed in real time.

                                                             Usage
1.Remote Meetings & Conferencing: Adds professionalism or privacy in video calls.

2.Streaming & Content Creation: Lets creators add custom backgrounds during live streams.

3.Virtual Classrooms: Teachers can replace backgrounds for better engagement or to hide distractions.

4.Photography & Video Booths: Enables dynamic backgrounds for photo/video sessions.

                                                          Conclusion
This project provides a simple and effective way to replace backgrounds in real-time video feeds using basic image processing techniques. Without requiring advanced AI models, it performs well under controlled lighting and with a consistent background color. While not as accurate as deep learning-based segmentation, it serves as a fast, resource-efficient alternative ideal for lightweight applications. Future enhancements could include automatic background detection or integration with semantic segmentation models for better accuracy across diverse environments.
